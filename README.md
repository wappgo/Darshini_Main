Project Title : Darshini AI 

Team ID : Overview Darshni AI is an AI-powered Conversational and Management Intelligence system designed to assist all types of visitors—regardless of age, literacy level, language, or digital proficiency. Imagine having a virtual assistant available 24/7 through video call, phone call, or chat, guiding and supporting you throughout Simhasth.Problem

Clear articulation of the problem we are solving The Maha Kumbh Mela is one of the largest spiritual events in the world, drawing millions of visitors from various regions, age groups, and linguistic backgrounds. Managing such a diverse and dynamic crowd presents significant logistical and operational challenges. Despite heavy planning and physical infrastructure, several key problems remain unresolved.


*****Core Problems Addressed by Darshini AI*****

    1. Crowd Management & Surveillance
* Uncoordinated crowd movement leads to congestion, confusion, and safety concerns. Traditional manpower is insufficient to provide real-time guidance at scale.

    2. Navigation Management
* Navigating the vast and complex event grounds—featuring hundreds of pandals, temples, facilities, and routes—can be overwhelming, especially for first-time and elderly visitors. During the Simhastha, commonly used navigation tools like Google Maps often fail to function effectively. This is primarily because a temporary city is constructed specifically for the event, with unique layouts and infrastructure planned only for the two-month duration. As a result, no existing navigation system is fully aware of or compatible with this temporary setup.
    3. Traffic and Vehicle Entry Mismanagement
* Vehicle traffic is often chaotic, with numerous drivers attempting to access restricted zones. Unauthorized or misprinted vehicle passes are commonly used due to the lack of digital verification. The absence of a centralized or automated system for validating and monitoring vehicle movement results in congestion, security vulnerabilities, and inconsistent access control.
    4. Lost & Found Management
* Managing missing persons and lost belongings is a significant challenge during mass gatherings. Delays in reporting and recovery often lead to distress and inefficiencies. Simply setting up Lost & Found centers without proper technological support is insufficient—it can create confusion and place excessive pressure on these centers.
    5. Information Broadcasting Management
* Broadcasting timely and location-specific updates—such as ritual schedules, changes, or urgent alerts—is challenging with traditional methods like loudspeakers or physical notice boards. These conventional systems are inadequate for effectively delivering time-sensitive information across such a large and dispersed area.
    6. Digital Literacy and Device Accessibility
* A large portion of attendees are not digitally literate or may not own smartphones. Relying solely on a mobile app excludes a significant segment of the population from receiving assistance or information.
    7. Language and Accessibility Barriers
* Attendees speak a wide variety of languages, and many are unfamiliar with Hindi or English. This makes it difficult to access crucial information without multilingual support.
    8. Overload on Physical Helpdesks
* Volunteers and information booths often become overwhelmed due to the high footfall, leading to slow response times and frequent miscommunication. In such conditions, it becomes difficult to handle emergency situations—such as medical crises—promptly and effectively.
    9. Lack of Personalized, On-demand Assistance
* Most services are static and do not offer individualized responses based on real-time needs or specific user queries.
    10. Limited Feedback Mechanisms & Analytics
* Real-time collection of visitor feedback and service-related complaints is poorly managed, limiting the ability to make timely improvements. Moreover, there is no structured system to analyze visitor demographics, behavior patterns, or other critical analytics—hindering data-driven decision-making and overall event optimization.


*****Solution***** 
Here is how Darshini AI overcomes the above mentioned problems by offering

1. Multi-Channel Accessibility
Available through kiosks with video chat support, WhatsApp, and voice call assistance, as well as a mobile app ensuring accessibility even for those who may not be comfortable using mobile apps or digital technology.

2. Real-Time Multilingual & Personalized Support
Delivers personalized responses in multiple Indian and international languages, including Hindi, English, Gujarati, Marathi, and Rajasthani—with zero latency. It also supports Bhashini across all communication channels such as voice, chat, and more, effectively breaking language and accessibility barriers

3.Conversation Intelligence with Built-in Map Navigation
Users can interact with Darshini using natural language—no need to type or navigate through apps. Darshini comes equipped with an advanced built-in map navigation system, specifically designed to solve temporary city planning and event navigation challenges. It supports custom coordinate mapping and custom route planning for hyper-localized use cases.

4. Smart Crowd Management & Surveillance
Darshini AI is equipped with a built-in navigation feature and an intelligent crowd management system designed to handle various real-world scenarios. 

5. Lost & Found Reporting & Tracking with Darshini AI
During events like Simhastha, thousands of people gather, and it’s common for both individuals and belongings to get lost. Traditionally, if someone loses an item, they visit the nearest Lost & Found Center to report it. Similarly, if someone finds an item, they hand it over to the center. While this method works, it lacks proper inventory management, real-time tracking, and a centralized database. That’s where Darshini AI comes into play.

6.Intelligent Vehicle Access and Traffic Control System
a. Digital Vehicle Pass System- Implement a QR-based or RFID-enabled digital vehicle pass system integrated with a central database. Each pass is uniquely linked to vehicle and owner details, entry permissions, and validity period. 
b. Automated Entry Validation at Checkpoints- Deploy smart gates or handheld scanners at all vehicle entry points. These devices will scan and validate vehicle passes in real-time, rejecting expired, duplicated, or unauthorized entries instantly. 
c. Centralized Monitoring Dashboard- Establish a centralized traffic and vehicle movement control dashboard for authorities. This system will provide real-time data on vehicle entries, pass usage, and movement patterns. 
d. Geo-fencing and ANPR Integration- Use geo-fencing and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology to monitor vehicle movement inside restricted zones. Unauthorized vehicle presence will trigger instant alerts. 
e. Real-time Traffic Analytics- Leverage AI-based traffic analytics to detect congestion, suggest dynamic route diversions, and optimize entry/exit scheduling based on vehicle density. 
f. Access Hierarchies and Role-Based Permissions- Set access rules based on the role, event, or day—for example, restricting commercial vehicle entry during peak hours or giving priority to emergency services. 
g. Misuse Prevention and Audit Trails- Maintain digital logs of all vehicle entries and pass verifications for auditing and investigating misuse or breach attempts.

7. Unified Smart Broadcasting System
This system built-in with Darshini AI, addresses the limitations of traditional loudspeakers and physical notices in disseminating timely, location-specific information during large-scale events like the Kumbh Mela. This intelligent, centralized broadcasting system ensures that critical updates—such as ritual schedules, emergency alerts, or route changes—are instantly relayed from the command center to all deployed kiosks, mobile applications, and communication channels like WhatsApp and phone calls. Whether targeting the entire crowd or specific user groups or zones, the system enables fast, accurate, and multilingual communication—both visually and audibly—enhancing safety, awareness, and the overall experience for every participant.

8.Intelligent Logging & Decisions Making
Darshini AI comes with advanced logging and feedback mechanisms designed to overcome the limitations of traditional feedback systems and analytics at large-scale events like the Kumbh Mela. It continuously captures real-time feedback, system usage logs, and visitor interactions across all connected kiosks, mobile apps, and touchpoints. This centralized, intelligent data collection enables authorities to make timely, data-driven decisions, quickly identify service gaps, and enhance overall event operations. In addition, the system builds a long-term knowledge base that helps planners anticipate future challenges, improve infrastructure, and deliver a better experience for all attendees.


9. Data Collection (Real-Time & Continuous)
Darshini collects real-time, continuous feedback and usage data through multiple touchpoints, including in-app feedback prompts, chatbot interactions, multilingual kiosk forms, voice feedback for illiterate users or senior citizens (transcribed using AI), and quick complaint buttons for issues like missing persons, sanitation, or security. All user interactions—such as pages visited, queries asked, languages selected, and session durations—are securely logged and anonymized, while an AI-powered analytics dashboard enables live monitoring of complaints, heatmaps of high-traffic zones, and trends in language or demographic preferences. Darshini’s AI further drives decision support by detecting anomalies (e.g., repeated complaints from a specific sector), suggesting priority actions (like deploying more water kiosks at crowded gates), and performing sentiment analysis on feedback to capture visitor mood. Additionally, audience profiling based on language, service interests, and optional age-group analysis helps authorities tailor communication, optimize resource allocation, and plan future infrastructure improvements effectively.


*****Logic & Workflow***** 
We have completed and demonstrated the following modules:

Conversational Intelligence Supports KIOSK , Mobile App , Web , Whatsapp & Call 

    * Video Conversational Intelligence Module 
    * Chatbot module
    * Voice call AI module

   These handle queries and solve problems related to:

    * Navigation support
    * Information seeking
    * Crowd management
    * Safety and security
    * Access and mobility
    * Emergency handling

    Example queries the system can answer:

    * “Barfani Baba ka ashram kaha hai?”
    * “Main abhi kaha khada hoon?”
    * “Sahi snan kis tareekh ko hai?”
    * “Kya koi road block hai?”
    * “Yahaan aag lag gayi hai!”
    * “Mere bhai ko heart attack aaya hai!”

The intelligence module is capable of responding to these and more. Additionally, we have attached a knowledge base repository so that users can query further based on structured information.

Person Detection & Surveillance
    * A GUI interface has been developed to connect with live camera feeds across the Simhasth.
    * Instead of monitoring each feed manually, the system allows the user to upload a person’s image.
    * The AI then searches across past recorded data and monitors live feeds in real time.
    * Once the person appears, the system provides relevant details.
    * For demo purposes, we used a small dataset, but in production, this can be integrated with live camera feeds and scaled with enhanced GPU capacity.

Lost & Found Item Management
    * We demonstrated how Lost & Found centers can be centralized with Darshni AI.
    * Using AI/ML, lost items can be quickly identified and retrieved from a centralized database.
    * This ensures faster recovery and improved efficiency during large gatherings.
